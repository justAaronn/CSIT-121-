<h2>What is XML</h2>
<h3>Extensible Markup Language is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.</h3>

<h2>How is XML used? </h2>
<h3>XML supports information exchange between computer systems such as websites, databases, and third-party applications. Predefined rules make it easy to transmit data as XML files over any network because the recipient can use those rules to read the data accurately and efficiently.
</h3>

<h2> What does XML look like?</h2>
<h3> An Xml file looks like this:</h3>
<div style="text-align:center;">
	<img src="images/file.jpg" alt="xml file" width="700" height="800"></div>

<h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
<h3>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</h3>

<h2>How is Javascript related to HTML and CSS</h2>
<h3> HTML creates and structures the website's content, CSS adds style and formatting to these structures, and then JavaScript turns those stylized components into something that a user can interact with. Say you want to build a website where users can fill out a form for a contest.</h3>

<h2>What are some common Javascript elements, properties, methods, and functions?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>documents.form</li>
	<li>innerHtml</li>
	<li>removeChild</li>
	<li>appendChild</li>
</ul>
