    <p><h3>Lagos is Nigeria's largest city and one of the largest in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late 15th century Lagos Island had been settled by Yoruba fishermen and hunters, who called it Oko. The area was dominated by the kingdom of Benin, which called it Eko, from the late 16th century to the mid-19th century.</h3> </p>
